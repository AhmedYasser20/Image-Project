    Hu Moments ( or rather Hu moment invariants ) are a set of 7 numbers calculated using central 
    moments that are invariant to image transformations. The first 6 moments have been proved to be 
    invariant to translation,scale, and rotation, and reflection. While the 7th momentâ€™s sign 
    changes for image reflection.
